## Work Experience


## I. Vicor corporation - Andover,MA
### Application Engineer co op ( Jan-Jul 2020 )

#### Company overview : Manufactures the dc-dc modules mainly 48V to 12 V. I was working as an application engineer. 

#### My work was distributed in 4 parts:

##### 1.	Tested demo boards
  - Checked and verified different demo modules, output responses using an oscilloscope 
  - Verified that using GUI in the software
  - Measurement contains the output response at various stages of the modules.
  - Current, Voltages, temperature measurement
  
##### 2.	Development of GUI
 - Set the communication path for two modules
 - Done all testing using real module
 
##### 3.	Report
- This was new software so Vicor did not has any documentation so I created a report which explains  everything about setting a new module
-	New co-op/ internal people can easily use it and save time in future

##### 4.	MATLAB
-	We can develop flow chart using coding but at the same time we can also use MATLAB to develop flow chart, easy to understand for any engineer and changes can be made easily

-	Overall a really good experience working as an application engineer, learned a verity of stuff starting from creating a report to testing modules to developing the GUI

## II. ONGC - Surat, INDIA
### Electrical Engineering Intern ( May-Jun 2016 )

- First industry experience back in India.  
- The full name of the company is Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited.  
- So the company is mainly towards producing oil and natural gas. So you might be wonder what did I did in my internship.  
- But by using natural gas, they are producing electricity and supply throughout the plant.  
- The plant has the capacity of producing 60MW but they only produce the 30 MW. For the plant, they utilize around 15-20MW according to the need and remaining supply to the commercial grid. 
- During this time, I learned a little bit about the maintenance of various electrical equipment like an induction motor, circuit breaker, transformer, etc. 
- Apart from that, they have one UPS station to maintain the supply constant through the plant when any false in the electricity generation.
